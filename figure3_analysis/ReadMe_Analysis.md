# Description of Analysis notebooks
1. Event_align_plots.ipynb - Creating ionic current distribution for target section of MCM5 22:35424403-35424411

2. gm12878_genes.ipynb - Subsampling experiment counting the number of GM12878 genes captured across cell line combinations (HeLa & A549, HepG2 & NTERA, All cell lines).

3. gm12878_saturation - Subsampling experiment counting the number of alignment hits for the top 10 genes of GM12878 (established via subsampling)

4. Saturation_Curves.ipynb - Subsampling experiment showing the power of 4 cell lines to capture the genes represented by a 5th cell line. Repeated with all 5 of our cell lines as the target cell line.

5. Subsample_Gene_Binary.ipynb - Using gene representation binaries for each cell line and completing a pairwise dice similarity measurement

6. unique_gene_count.ipynb - Subsampling experiment to determine the number of genes in each of our cell lines from up to 1,000,000 reads.
